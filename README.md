## about
  ```
     Being a busy week for me, I just had to make this as minimalistic as possible. This project contains the would be ability of the super admin in this APP. API authentication and authorization were not implemented as I just needed to submit before deadline. However, SOLID principle was followed strictly and this to an extent shows how I approach Software Development. Thanks!
